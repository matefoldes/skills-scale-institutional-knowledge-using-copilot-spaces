# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes and links to the detailed process documents used for planning, executing, and operating cross-functional work. These docs are intended for new joiners, product and delivery leads, and anyone contributing to project delivery — they describe roles, core artifacts, workflows, communication cadence, risk handling, and continuous improvement practices.

OctoAcme uses a lightweight, iterative lifecycle: Initiation (one-pager and stakeholder alignment), Planning (backlog, estimates, release plan), Execution & Tracking (small PRs, CI, daily/weekly rhythms), Release & Deployment (checklists, smoke tests, rollback plans), and Close/Retrospective (action items fed back to the backlog). Key personas — Product Manager (PdM), Project Manager (PM), Developers, QA, and Stakeholders — have distinct responsibilities that are coordinated through a set cadence of standups, delivery syncs, and stakeholder updates. Quality assurance is enforced through automated tests and security scans in CI, manual QA where needed, and post-release verifications.

Communication and risk management are explicit: a simple Risk Register (ID, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation) is reviewed weekly, and communication templates (weekly status, incident summary) are used to keep stakeholders informed. Releases follow a standardized checklist and incident playbook with defined escalation paths. Retrospectives focus on a few high-impact action items that are tracked as issues and reviewed in subsequent planning and PM syncs.
